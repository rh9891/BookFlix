## Description

Welcome to BookFlix, the ultimate app for those who canâ€™t decide between diving into a captivating book or enjoying a thrilling movie! Whether you're searching for a specific title or looking for inspiration for your next read or watch, BookFlix is here to help you explore both mediums side by side.

A multimedia search application that utilizes the Google Books API, OMDB API, and AJAX calls to search for user-inputted titles of movies and books simultaneously. The application was built using jQuery, JavaScript, Express, Node, and the Materialize framework.

How It Works:

- Search for Titles: Enter the title of a book or movie in the search bar, and let BookFlix find matches for you.
- Explore Both Worlds: View detailed information about the book and movie, including synopses, authors, directors, ratings, and more.
- Make Informed Choices: Compare options easily to see which story resonates with you.
- Discover New Favorites: Not sure what to pick? Use the app to explore new titles and find your next great read or watch!

Whether you're a bookworm or a film buff, BookFlix offers a seamless way to discover and enjoy stories in both formats. Let us guide you on your journey of exploration and help you find the perfect tale to immerse yourself in!

## User Story

```
AS A reader and movie watcher
I WANT to look up book and movie recommendations and compare the two mediums
SO THAT I can find information about authors/directors, decide if I am more interested in watching the movie or reading the book, and be directed to links to purchase the book or watch the trailer of the movie that interests me.
```

## Features of the Application:

```
GIVEN a media search dashboard with a form input
WHEN I input a title into the search box
THEN I am presented with a selection of information for books and movies.

WHEN I scroll through the selection of books displayed
THEN I am presented with the specific book title, the author, the synopsis, publication date, average user rating, page count, and access to purchase the book through Google Books.

WHEN I scroll through the selection of movies displayed
THEN I am presented with the specific movie title, the director, the synopsis, IMDb rating, the parental rating, date of release, and access to watch the trailer through IMDb.

WHEN I click the reset button
THEN the search input is cleared, and the displayed book and movie results are removed, returning the UI to its initial state.
```
